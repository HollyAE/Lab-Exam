# Repository Overview:

This repository contains the code for an assignment I completed as part of the Object Oriented Software Engineering course I took in the second year of my degree.

Within the labexamstart folder there is:
- A Class Diagram image to show how the classes of the project interact with one another
- A Design Pattern md file which explains my choice for the design patterns I implemented
- The src/main/java folder which contains the project code itself

The project can be run from the Race.java file, where the main method is implemented.
